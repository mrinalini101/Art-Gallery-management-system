# Art Gallery Exhibition Management System

## Description
The **Art Gallery Exhibition Management System** is a Python-based GUI application that helps manage exhibitions by providing tools for various calculations such as:
- Function Points calculation.
- Effort estimation using the **COCOMO** model.
- Effort estimation using the **STRS** model.
- Financial metrics like **NPV**, **ROI**, and **Payback Period**.
- Earned Value Analysis (**EVA**).

The application is built using the **Tkinter** library for the graphical user interface.

## Features
1. **Function Points Calculation**:
   - Estimates function points based on user-defined inputs.
2. **COCOMO Effort Estimation**:
   - Calculates effort and development time based on KLOC (thousands of lines of code).
3. **STRS Effort Estimation**:
   - Effort estimation using object points.
4. **Financial Metrics**:
   - Provides Net Present Value (NPV), Return on Investment (ROI), Payback Period, and Total Profit.
5. **Earned Value Analysis**:
   - Calculates Schedule Variance (SV), Cost Variance (CV), Schedule Performance Index (SPI), and Cost Performance Index (CPI).
